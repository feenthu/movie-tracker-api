# AI-Assisted Development for Basket Service

This directory contains the AI-assisted development workflow and templates for the Basket Service repository.

## Purpose

The purpose of this AI-assisted development approach is to:

1. **Streamline Development**: Accelerate the development process through AI assistance
2. **Ensure Quality**: Maintain high code quality and consistency
3. **Preserve Knowledge**: Document requirements and implementation decisions
4. **Standardize Collaboration**: Provide a structured framework for AI-human collaboration

## Key Files

- **workflow.md**: The main workflow documentation that outlines the process
- **prompts.md**: Example prompts to guide AI through each phase of the workflow
- **templates/**: Templates for each phase of the development process:
  - **requirements.md**: Template for requirement specifications
  - **implementation-plan.md**: Template for implementation plans
  - **code-review.md**: Template for code reviews

## How to Use

1. **Start a New Feature**:
   - Create a new folder under `.requirements/` with your feature name
   - Follow the workflow phases outlined in `workflow.md`

2. **Refine Requirements**:
   - Use the requirements template to create a detailed specification
   - Save the specification in `.requirements/[feature-name]/specification.md`

3. **Plan Implementation**:
   - Create an implementation plan based on the template
   - Save the plan in `.requirements/[feature-name]/implementation-plan.md`

4. **Implement Code**:
   - Follow the implementation plan to generate code
   - Save code artifacts in `.requirements/[feature-name]/code/`

5. **Create Tests**:
   - Develop tests according to the testing strategy
   - Save test artifacts in `.requirements/[feature-name]/tests/`

## Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: Provide specific and clear requirements
2. **Iterate**: Expect multiple iterations to refine AI-generated artifacts
3. **Provide Context**: Give AI sufficient context about the existing codebase
4. **Review Thoroughly**: Always review AI-generated artifacts carefully
5. **Maintain Consistency**: Ensure AI-generated code follows project standards

## Example

See the workflow.md file for a detailed example of how to use this AI-assisted development approach.
