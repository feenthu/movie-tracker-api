To complete the [feature-name] feature, I need to update documentation.

Please help me with:
1. Adding proper JavaDoc comments to the code
2. Creating a sequence diagram that shows the flow of the new feature
3. Updating any necessary sections in the README.md, including the ubiquitous language section if needed
