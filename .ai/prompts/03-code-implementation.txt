I'd like to implement the code for the [feature-name] feature based on the implementation plan in .requirements/[feature-name]/implementation-plan.md.

Please help me implement [specific component or step from the plan] directly in the main source directories. Follow our project's coding standards (use var declarations when type can be inferred, use Optional instead of nested null checks, etc.).

No need to create reference implementations in the .requirements directory - let's implement the actual code directly in the project structure.
