# Requirement Specification: User Authentication GraphQL Mutations

## Overview

Implement user authentication GraphQL mutations for the movie tracker API to enable basic user registration and login functionality. This implementation will provide a foundation for CRUD operations while being extensible for future enhancements like email verification, OAuth2 integration, and advanced security features.

## Business Context

**Business Problem**: Users need to authenticate to track their personal movie experiences, ensuring data privacy and enabling personalized features.

**Stakeholders**: 
- End users who want to track their movie experiences
- Frontend developers who will integrate with these authentication APIs
- Future administrators who may need user management capabilities

**Impact**: Enables secure user accounts and forms the foundation for all personalized features in the movie tracker application.

## Functional Requirements

### Core Functionality

1. **User Registration (`register` mutation)**:
   - Accept email, username, password, and optional firstName/lastName
   - Hash passwords securely using BCrypt
   - Validate email and username uniqueness
   - Return JWT token and user data upon successful registration
   - Handle validation errors gracefully

2. **User Login (`login` mutation)**:
   - Accept email and password
   - Authenticate against stored credentials
   - Return JWT token and user data upon successful login
   - Handle authentication failures gracefully

3. **JWT Token Management**:
   - Generate JWT tokens with industry-standard expiration (1 hour for access tokens)
   - Include user ID and email in token claims
   - Implement token validation for protected operations
   - Use secure signing algorithm (HS256 or RS256)

4. **Authentication Context**:
   - Provide authenticated user context to GraphQL resolvers
   - Implement `me` query to retrieve current authenticated user
   - Secure mutation operations that modify user data

### User Interactions

- Users register through GraphQL `register` mutation with required fields
- Users login through GraphQL `login` mutation with email/password
- Users receive JWT tokens to authenticate subsequent requests
- Frontend includes JWT token in Authorization header for protected operations

### Integration Points

- Integrates with existing User entity and UserRepository
- Works with current Spring Security configuration
- Compatible with Netflix DGS GraphQL framework
- Maintains existing database schema structure

## Domain Model

### Domain Concepts

- **User**: Person who uses the movie tracker application
- **Authentication**: Process of verifying user identity
- **Authorization**: Process of determining what authenticated user can access
- **JWT Token**: Secure token containing user claims for stateless authentication
- **Password Hash**: Securely stored password using BCrypt encryption

### Relationship to Existing Domain

- Extends existing User entity (no schema changes needed)
- Uses existing UserRepository for database operations
- Builds upon current Spring Security foundation
- Supports existing OAuth2 fields for future integration

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance Requirements

- Authentication operations should complete within 500ms under normal load
- JWT token validation should be fast (< 10ms) for frequent operations
- Password hashing should use appropriate BCrypt rounds (10-12) for security vs performance balance

### Scalability Considerations

- JWT tokens are stateless, supporting horizontal scaling
- Database queries use indexed fields (email, username)
- Ready for future caching layer implementation

### Security Considerations

- Passwords are never stored in plain text (BCrypt hashing)
- JWT tokens use secure signing algorithms
- Sensitive operations require valid authentication
- Input validation prevents injection attacks
- Future-ready for rate limiting and account lockout features

## Implementation Approach

### Authentication Toggle System

Implement feature flags for different authentication methods:
```java
@ConfigurationProperties(prefix = "app.auth")
public class AuthConfig {
    private boolean localAuthEnabled = true;
    private boolean oauth2Enabled = false;
    // Future: integrate with feature flag service like Unleash
}
```

### JWT Token Strategy

- **Access Token**: 1 hour expiration (industry standard for prototypes)
- **Claims**: user_id, email, issued_at, expires_at
- **Algorithm**: HS256 with secure secret key
- **Future Enhancement**: Refresh tokens for longer sessions

### Authorization Strategy

- Protected mutations: addMovie, updateUserMovie, deleteUserMovie
- Public queries: searchMovies, movie(id), health
- Authenticated queries: me, myMovies
- Implementation uses method-level security annotations

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Registration Success**: User can register with valid email/username/password and receives JWT token
2. **Registration Validation**: Registration fails appropriately for duplicate email/username
3. **Login Success**: User can login with valid email/password and receives JWT token
4. **Login Failure**: Login fails appropriately for invalid credentials
5. **Token Validation**: Valid JWT tokens allow access to protected operations
6. **Token Rejection**: Invalid/expired tokens are rejected properly
7. **Me Query**: Authenticated users can query their profile information
8. **Protected Operations**: Movie CRUD operations require valid authentication
9. **Feature Toggle**: Local authentication can be enabled/disabled via configuration

## Out of Scope

The following features are explicitly out of scope for this phase:

- Email verification workflow
- Password reset functionality
- Account lockout after failed attempts
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- OAuth2 provider implementation
- Refresh token management
- Advanced password requirements
- Rate limiting
- Session management
- User profile management mutations

## Technical Implementation Notes

### JWT Configuration
- Use application.yml for JWT configuration (secret, expiration)
- Implement JwtService for token operations
- Create custom authentication filter for GraphQL

### Error Handling
- Return meaningful error messages for authentication failures
- Use GraphQL error formatting for consistent API responses
- Log security events appropriately (without sensitive data)

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for authentication service logic
- Integration tests for GraphQL mutations
- Security tests for token validation
- Test both success and failure scenarios

## Future Extension Points

This implementation provides foundation for:

1. **OAuth2 Integration**: Separate OAuth2 data fetchers using existing provider fields
2. **Email Verification**: Add email verification workflow with tokens
3. **Advanced Security**: Rate limiting, account lockout, password policies
4. **Role Management**: RBAC system with user roles and permissions
5. **Session Management**: Refresh tokens and session invalidation
6. **Feature Flags**: Integration with external feature flag services
