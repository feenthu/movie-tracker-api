I want to use our AI-assisted development workflow (as defined in .ai/workflow.md) to implement a new feature for our movie tracker api service.

The initial requirement is: "Add user authentication GraphQL mutations"

Let's start with Phase 1: Requirement Refinement. Please ask me clarifying questions to understand this requirement better, and then we'll create a detailed specification using the template in .ai/templates/requirements.md.

Once we complete the specification, we'll move through each phase of the workflow:
1. Create separate implementation and test plans
2. Implement the code directly in the main source directories based on the implementation plan
3. Implement the tests directly in the main test directories based on the test plan
4. Update documentation

Please save the specification, implementation plan, and test plan in the .requirements/user-authentication-graphql-mutations/ directory with the appropriate structure.
