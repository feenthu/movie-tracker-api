I need to design the database changes for the [feature-name] feature.

Based on our implementation plan, please create the SQL migration script that would:
1. Create any new tables needed
2. Add any columns to existing tables
3. Create appropriate indexes and constraints

I'll implement this SQL migration script directly in the main source files.
